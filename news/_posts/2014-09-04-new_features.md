* vmtkmeshreader now supports VTK XML parallel file format ( .pvtu files ).

* vmtkmeshmergetimesteps can handle mesh files with velocity component arrays or velocity vector.

Those features are available in the [vmtk development version]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/#development_version) and they will be added in the next binary release of vmtk (1.3).
