<a href="http://goo.gl/C1ulrS" target="_blank">vmtk Academy</a> is the first interactive teaching tool for image-based modeling.<br/>

Wouldn't it be great to integrate a "hands-on" <b>teaching tool</b> for education in image based modeling?<br/>
vmtkAcademy is a <b>cloud-based</b> system that brings advanced modeling to the classroom, from medical images all the way to simulation.<br/>
Nothing to install and nothing to download, all you need is a <b>web-browser</b>. Pay for what you use, no set-up required!<br/>

CFD-as-a-service with an intuitive <b>web-based</b> interface: <b>3D</b> incompressible Navier-Stokes solver and <b>0D/1D</b> solver for lumped parameter simulations or boundary conditions.<br/>

The cloud technology behind <b>vmtkAcademy</b> is also available as a platform for researchers and industry.
